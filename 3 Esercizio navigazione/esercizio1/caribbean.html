                    History
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, you want to get up and dance. Music compels your body to move. Think of salsa, mambo, and calypso. They're all part of Caribbean dance. Have you heard music from places like Cuba, Trinidad, or the Dominican Republic? These Caribbean islands have strong cultures of music and dance.

                <p>
                    Before we get to dancing, let's define Caribbean geography. It's a group of more than 7,000 islands in the Caribbean Sea scattered southeast of Gulf of Mexico, east of Central America, and north of South America. The Caribbean includes Cuba, Hispaniola (the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Trinidad and Tobago, among others.

                <p>
                    Caribbean dance evolved from complex influences, including slavery and colonialism. Enslaved Africans, brought to the islands to work on vast plantations, carried customs and drumming traditions with them. Using available materials, they crafted instruments and kept elements of their cultures alive. French and Spanish colonists came with their music and dance customs. Caribbean dance also adopted elements of dances from ceremonies of indigenous cultures like the Taino people, who lived on several islands including Cuba and Jamaica.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, customs blended and became new music and dance. Regardless of style, there's a familiar pattern in historical development: Afro-Caribbean people maintain and build on dance customs through time. Although initially looked down upon by those in the upper classes (regarded the expressiveness and body moves salacious and vulgar), styles persisted and evolved. They grew in popularity first in local neighborhoods and then found their way to broader appeal.
